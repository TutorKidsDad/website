## Introduction

The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it ideal for IoT and automation projects. This repository contains a variety of examples showcasing how to use the ESP32 to create smart systems for home, industry, and more.

## Projects

### Smart Home Automation

In this project, the ESP32 is used to automate appliances, lighting, and more through an IoT platform. The project supports remote control via a mobile app and can integrate with voice assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa.

- [Code and documentation](https://github.com/TutorKidsDad/Esp32/tree/main/smart-home-automation)
- Features:
  - MQTT protocol for communication
  - Real-time monitoring and control
  - Integration with smart assistants

### IoT Weather Station

A wireless weather station built using the ESP32 to monitor environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Data is uploaded to a cloud service for real-time monitoring.

- [Code and documentation](https://github.com/TutorKidsDad/Esp32/tree/main/iot-weather-station)
- Features:
  - DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity
  - BME280 sensor for atmospheric pressure
  - Web dashboard for data visualization

### ESP32 Web Server

This project demonstrates how to create a web server using the ESP32 to control GPIO pins from a web interface.

- [Code and documentation](https://github.com/TutorKidsDad/Esp32/tree/main/esp32-web-server)
- Features:
  - Simple interface to control LEDs or relays
  - Real-time updates using AJAX

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board
- Various sensors (DHT11, BME280, etc.)
- Relays, LEDs, and other peripherals
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and the ESP32 core for Arduino. Follow these steps:

1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Add the ESP32 core by following [these instructions](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions).
3. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TutorKidsDad/Esp32.git
